     <h2>Description</h2>
     <p>Because of the fact that these crêpes are so healthy compared to the other snacks
        that are readily available in the supermarket, sometimes I like to make some for the kids and I.

     </p>
     <p>It took me a long time to find the perfect balance between sugary-sweet and healthy, and with this recipe, I think I've
        hit the nail on the head.
     </p>
     <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul><li>1 Cup of white whole wheat flower</li>
        <li>2 Eggs</li>
        <li>Half a cup of low-fat milk</li>
        <li>Half a cup of water</li>
        <li>A quarter teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
        <li>Half a cup of non-fat plain Greek yoghurt</li>
        <li>A quarter of a cup of maple syrup</li>
        <li>Half a cup of blueberries</li>
     </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol><li>Whisk together flour and eggs in a large mixing bowl. Gradually add milk and water, stirring to combine. Mix in butter and salt and beat until smooth
</li>
<li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop 1/4 cup batter onto griddle. Tilt pan with a circular motion so batter coats the surface evenly.</li>
<li>Cook crepe until bottom is light brown, about 2 minutes. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook other side. Serve hot with yogurt, maple syrup, and blueberries.</li>

</ol>
